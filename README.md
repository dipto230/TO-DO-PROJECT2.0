The Cloud-Based Task Manager is a web application designed to streamline team task management. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js), this platform provides a user-friendly interface for efficient task assignment, tracking, and collaboration. The application caters to administrators and regular users, offering comprehensive features to enhance productivity and organization.
